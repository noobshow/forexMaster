Program using FIX Protocol to connect with cTrader brokers and trade currency  
FIX Protocol is written from scratch which could have not been the best idea for first multithreaded project but at least it works 乁( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ㄏ  
Basic functionality works but no real trading algorithm is implemented  
Project suspended until I learn neural networks
