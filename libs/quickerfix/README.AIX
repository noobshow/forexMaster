I was able to get the 64 bit version of QuickFIX library to compile on AIX 6100-09-05-1524 with IBM XL C/C++ for AIX, V12.1.
Unit tests do not compile so these were disabled.

Example script:

#!/bin/sh

cflagx=-q64
cxxflagx="-q64 -D__IBMCPP_TR1__"
ldflagx=-q64

OBJECT_MODE=64
export OBJECT_MODE

./bootstrap

CC=xlc_r CXX=xlC_r CFLAGS=$cflagx CXXFLAGS=$cxxflagx LDFLAGS=$ldflagx configure --prefix="Your prefix"

make && make install
